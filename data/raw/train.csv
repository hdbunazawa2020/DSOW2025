Each of the four substitution sites is connected through an ethynyl linker (–C≡C–) to a para-substituted phenyl ring, giving four identical phenylethynyl arms. On each peripheral phenyl ring, the para position carries an octyloxy group (–O–(CH2)7CH3), so the structure contains five benzene rings total (one core plus four peripheral) and four carbon–carbon triple bonds.

A typical synthesis proceeds by first preparing the peripheral arm as a 4-alkoxy-substituted terminal arylacetylene (e.g., via O-alkylation of 4-hydroxy-substituted aryl precursors to install the octyloxy ether, followed by introduction of an ethynyl group). The four arms are then attached to a 1,2,4,5-tetrahalogenated benzene core using a Pd-catalyzed Sonogashira cross-coupling (often with a Cu co-catalyst and base), forming the four aryl–ethynyl C–C bonds that connect the arms to the central ring.",New_Gemini,paper_0476,False,0,

It is synthesized by a condensation reaction between a naphthalene tetracarboxylic acid dianhydride (or related mono-/dianhydride precursor) and o-phenylenediamine. The reaction forms the fused N-heterocyclic ring closures onto the aromatic anhydride core to generate a mixture of cis and trans isomers. The trans isomer can then be isolated by exploiting differences in salt formation/solubility via base-induced ring-opening to a potassium salt followed by re-closure/regeneration of the neutral perinone, or by acid-based fractionation of the mixed isomer product.",New_Gemini,paper_0495,False,0,

The overall anion therefore has one nitrogen atom linking the hydrophobic alkyl chain to the carbon-centered dicarboxylate fragment, and two sodium cations balance the two negative charges of the carboxylates.

The compound is described as being prepared as a disodium salt following previously reported procedures for disodium amino-acid-based surfactants. A typical synthetic connection consistent with this structure is formation of the N–C12 bond by N-alkylation of an aminomalonate/aminomalonic-acid precursor with a dodecyl electrophile (e.g., a dodecyl halide), followed by conversion of the two carboxylic acid/ester groups to the carboxylate form and neutralization with a sodium base to furnish the disodium dicarboxylate.",New_Gemini,paper_0087,False,0,

The biphenyl consists of two phenyl rings joined by a single C–C bond, bearing the hexyloxy substituent on one ring and a cyano group (–C≡N) on the para position of the other ring.

Synthesis (connectivity-focused): A common preparation route starts from a para-hydroxy, para-cyano biphenyl intermediate. The phenolic oxygen is alkylated via a Williamson ether synthesis with a six-carbon haloalcohol (or an equivalent protected variant) to install the terminal hydroxyhexyl ether substituent on the biphenyl. The resulting hydroxy-terminated intermediate is then converted to the acrylate by esterification using an activated acrylic acid derivative (e.g., acryloyl chloride) or a coupling-reagent-mediated reaction with acrylic acid, forming the terminal acrylate ester while retaining the biphenyl ether linkage and the nitrile substituent.",PubChem,paper_0165,False,0,
