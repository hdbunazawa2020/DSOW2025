The central boron atom is four-coordinate, bonding to the phenoxide oxygen and the benzothiazole nitrogen to create a six-membered O–B–N chelate ring, while also possessing two B–F bonds.

The synthesis begins with the functionalization of a substituted phenol precursor via Williamson ether formation, alkylating the phenolic oxygen with a dodecyl halide to attach the para-dodecyloxy chain. The benzothiazole framework is subsequently constructed by coupling this substituted component with 2-aminothiophenol through imine formation followed by intramolecular cyclization and oxidation.
