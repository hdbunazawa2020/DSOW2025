Synthesis: It can be assembled by forming two amide bonds between an activated terephthalic-acid derivative (commonly the diacyl chloride or another activated diacid equivalent) and an aniline-type precursor in which the aromatic ring already carries hydroxyl and carboxylic-acid substituents.

One ring bears a hexyloxy substituent (an O–(CH2)5CH3 ether) and also carries a carbonyl group that is esterified to the phenoxy oxygen of the second ring. The second benzene ring bears a para-substituted carboxylate ester, where the carboxyl carbonyl is bonded to an oxygen that is further connected to a chiral (S)-2-octyl group (an O–CH(CH3)–(CH2)5CH3 substituent).

Synthesis: A plausible preparation is based on stepwise formation of the ether and the two ester bonds. The hexyloxy substituent can be introduced by O-alkylation (Williamson ether synthesis) of a hydroxybenzoic/benzoyl precursor with a hexyl electrophile. The inter-ring benzoyloxy ester can be formed by acylation of a phenolic hydroxyl group on one ring with an activated benzoic-acid derivative (e.g., an acid chloride) bearing the hexyloxy substituent. Finally, the remaining benzoic-acid group on the second ring can be esterified with enantiomerically enriched (S)-2-octanol (or by coupling the acid with the alcohol using a standard esterification/condensation method) to furnish the chiral alkyl benzoate.",New_Gemini,paper_0139

Each imine carbon is part of a benzylidene fragment that connects through the imine nitrogen to a terminal phenyl ring, giving an overall tri-aromatic, linearly conjugated framework (phenyl–C=N–phenyl–N=C–phenyl in a symmetric arrangement).

Synthesis: Prepared by Schiff-base condensation of benzene-1,4-dicarbaldehyde (terephthalaldehyde) with two equivalents of aniline. The two aldehyde groups undergo nucleophilic addition by the amine nitrogens followed by dehydration to form the two C=N linkages, yielding the bis(imine) product, which is then isolated and purified (e.g., by recrystallization).",,paper_0445

A plausible synthesis assembles these connections by first forming the amide bond via coupling of a pyridine-carboxylic acid derivative (commonly activated as an acid chloride or equivalent) with a trichloroaniline to give the pyridine carboxamide. The remaining aryl–aryl bond can then be introduced using a palladium-catalyzed cross-coupling (e.g., Suzuki-type) between a halogenated pyridine intermediate and an appropriately substituted phenyl boron/organometallic partner that already bears the methylsulfonyl substituent (or by installing the methylsulfonyl group on the phenyl ring prior to the cross-coupling).",,paper_0259
